# Variwheeler

The Variwheeler is an omnidirectional car with variable geometry, it is characterized by the fact that the motor controllers can change position and regulate the height of the vehicle.

## Specifications

It should be noted that it has 4 laser sensors to avoid collisions and these same ones can use their omnidirectional wheels so that the entire car behaves like a lidar.

Typically, the car is controlled by Wi-Fi, TCP connection using a gyroscope and two resistive sensors that will determine its direction and geometry.
