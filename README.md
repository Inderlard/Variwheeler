## Specifications

It should be noted that it has 4 laser sensors to avoid collisions, it  has an extension below the front mobile platform for a QTR8-RC, and the servos, help to lock the geometry an cernain angle.

Typically, the car is controlled by Wi-Fi, TCP connection using a gyroscope and two resistive sensors that will determine its direction and geometry.
